## Introduction
This repository contains the projects I've completed as part of the Codecademy Data Science Machine Learning Specialist career path. The goal of these projects is to demonstrate my understanding of key machine learning concepts and my ability to apply them to real-world problems using Python.

## Project Overview
The projects within this repository cover a wide range of machine learning techniques, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in data.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Methods for understanding the characteristics and patterns within data.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model selection and evaluation: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms and assessing their effectiveness.
- Model deployment: Implementing trained models in real-world applications.

## Project Structure
Each project is organized into its own directory, containing:

- Jupyter Notebook(s): The primary code files where the analysis and modeling are conducted.
- Data: Any necessary datasets used in the project.

## Technologies Used
The projects primarily utilize the following Python libraries:

- NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Seaborn: For statistical visualizations. Â  
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
- TensorFlow: For deep learning models.

## Getting Started
To explore the projects:
Run the Jupyter Notebook(s): Open the notebook(s) using a Jupyter Notebook environment.
